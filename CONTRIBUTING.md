## Raising issues

Please raise any bug reports on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta/issues). Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.

A good bug report makes it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Legal

In order to make contribution as easy as possible, we follow the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) process for code contributions. We ask you to certify your contributions by signing off in your pull requests.

When you submit a pull request for review, you
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

The following example includes a `Signed-off-by` line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```text
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```bash
git commit -s
```

## Coding Standards

 - all PRs must pass Java CheckStyle checks
